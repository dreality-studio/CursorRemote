## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.41] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- Extension packaging now ships a vendored Socket.IO browser client so the web app loads correctly from a clean VSIX install without `node_modules`. Previously the server relied on Socket.IO's internal `client-dist/` files which were not included in the bundled extension package, causing `io is not defined` and a blank page on first use.
- Added favicon to the web client so browsers no longer 404 on `/favicon.ico`.

### Changed
- The publish script now always rebuilds the `.vsix` instead of reusing a potentially stale cached artifact, and runs a VSIX content verifier before publishing.
- Added a VSIX verification step (`scripts/verify-vsix.ts`) that checks for required runtime files and forbidden secrets before every package and publish.

## [0.1.40] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Web plan modal now loads the full saved plan file so `View Plan` on the web matches Telegram's richer full-plan view.
- Web plan model picker now shows the real plan-scoped model options fetched from Cursor before applying the selection.

### Changed
- Web connection status now distinguishes relay connectivity from Cursor/CDP extraction health, including clearer waiting states during background throttling.
- DOM extraction polling now uses single-flight retries with timeout backoff so backgrounded Cursor windows degrade more gracefully instead of hammering failed evaluations.
- Plan widget interactions are now handled directly in the web UI for modal viewing and model selection, while Build still triggers the underlying Cursor action.

### Fixed
- Older browsers that do not support `crypto.randomUUID()` no longer crash the web client during command creation.
- Run/Skip/Allow approval widgets now render and update correctly in the web app, including command text for terminal approval cards.
- Web live updates now reconcile message type changes correctly instead of leaving stale `Generating` placeholders until manual refresh.
- Auto-scroll no longer snaps back to the latest message after the user intentionally scrolls up.
- Plan modal content no longer stops at the compact widget summary when the underlying saved plan file is available.

## [0.1.39] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Native web code/diff renderer for assistant `codeBlocks` and tool `diffBlock`, with deterministic add/remove line styling.
- Mobile-friendly code block UX: ~7-line inline viewport with scroll and a full-screen reader.
- Telegram spoiler/shimmer mechanics for in-progress thought and activity presentation.

### Changed
- Assistant markdown HTML is now prose-only; code and diffs render from structured payloads instead of mirrored Cursor Monaco/Shiki HTML.
- Telegram formatter now maps structured code/diff blocks directly from `codeBlocks`.
- Activity state now uses a shared live-activity contract across relay, web, and Telegram.

### Fixed
- Removed brittle Monaco/Shiki mirror rendering and related duplicate, empty, or black code block failures in the web client.
- Native raw code blocks now preserve real newlines instead of flattening multiline code into a single `<code>` blob.
- Plain patch/unified-diff blocks are classified as diffs again, restoring red/green add/remove highlighting in the native renderer.
- Web app session persistence now survives re-login correctly instead of dropping saved auth/session state.
- Message sending reliability in the web app.
- Plan widget rendering and behavior in the web app.
- Explicit activity clearing now survives relay patch updates, so stale header shimmer/text does not persist in the web client.
- Telegram typing and ephemeral activity rows now stop based on live activity instead of stale status labels.
- Startup false positives like `Image generation stopped` no longer count as active work unless there is a real live signal.

## [0.1.38] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- Published to Open VSX registry so extension is searchable in Cursor's Extensions panel
- `--ovsx` flag in publish script to package and publish to Open VSX in one step

### Fixed
- Excluded `openvsx_token` from .vsix packaging and public repo sync
